<h2>How to make a website (with GitHub)</h2>
<div class="line"></div>
<p><h3>Step 1: Go to github.com</h3>
If you want to be extra cautious, go to google and type github in the search bar. Just in case you forget that it's github.com and not github.net or something (which might be malicious).</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<p><h3>Step 2: Click 'Sign Up' in the top right corner.</h3>
A very simple step.</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<p><h3>Step 3: Complete the sign up process.</h3>
Do NOT use your real name as your username! Also, it's a good idea to make your username easy to type e.g. 'johnshoes' (for a shoe website) instead of 'johnsuniqueshoescompany'. Your username dictates what your website is called.</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<p><h3>Step 4: Click 'start a project' in the centre of the screen.</h3>
Just in case you're wondering, the guide does not teach you how to host a website. It teaches you about the other functions of GitHub.</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<p><h3>Step 5: In the box titled 'Repository Name', type your username and then '.github.io'.</h3>
Don't include spaces. If you don't use your username, the website will not work.</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<p><h3>Step 6: Click 'Create Repository' at the bottom'.</h3>
This means that you have officially created the project for your website!</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<p><h3>Step 7: In the box titled 'Quick setup', click 'README'.</h3> This should be in the sentence that says 'Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a <em>README</em>...</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<p><h3>Step 8: Rename the 'README.md' to 'index.html'.</h3>
'index.html' is the URL that the browser uses for the homepage. If you go to your website, the index.html will be shown by default, even if it doesn't have 'index.html' in the URL.</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<p><h3>Step 9: Paste in your HTML code, and commit the changes!</h3>
It can take a while for the changes to come up. Use Notepad or another HTML editor to get the website working and looking right at first, then paste in the code. After that, your website is complete!</p>
